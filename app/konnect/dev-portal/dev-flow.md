title: Developer Flow

## Happy path

1. I somehow know I need to sign up for access to Dev Portal (internal: my manager tells me to so I can do my job, external: I'm partnering with this company and want to use their APIs for my app)
1. I sign up for Dev Portal
    * how do I know where to go to access the Dev Portal? Can the URL always be predicted, like `https://example.us.portal.konghq.com/`?
1. I get approved
1. I create my application with APIs in Dev Portal
    * what's an application? How do they relate to services and APIs?
1. My application is approved.

## Actual content below

Some explanation of Dev Portal. What does it do for me? Why would I want to register? Maybe what is an application.

## Flow

1. Navigate to Dev Portal and do one of the following:
    * Register for access by navigating to the Dev Portal and creating an account.
    * Sign in to the Dev Portal with single sign-on (SSO).
1. Once you're approved for access, you can create an application in Dev Portal by clicking **Catalog**. Click **Register** next to the API product version you want to create an application for and fill out the application information. <!-- my apps vs catalog, when do you use each?-->
1.
